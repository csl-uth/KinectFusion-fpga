# KinectFusion-fpga

This repository is about our evaluation of embedded MPSoC FPGA designs for KinectFusion. KinectFusion is a well-known dense SLAM algorithm which solves the problem of constructing and continuously updating a map of an unknown environment while keeping track of an agent's trajectory within this environment.

Our work will be uploaded soon.
